# Fluffy's Docs

A braindump wiki of different bits of (mainly security related) knowledge that I decided to write down

Also contains some writeups for some CTF challenges and similar

## Interesting Pages

- [MKDocs Cheatsheet](/cheatsheets/mkdocs) - How I made this Wiki
- [Pages tagged as polished](/tags.html#polished) - A little less brain-dumpy
- [Pwd Guessr](/writeups/BSides-CTF-2021/pwdguessr1) - An interesting CTF challenge that required scripting

!!! note
    Some of these pages were written for consumption by others, and some are written for my own reference  
    Expect variance in how coherent the different pages are
